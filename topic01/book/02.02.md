#Bootstrap Basics

In this step I will introduce Bootstrap and what it is and what it allows us to do in Moodle, where Bootstrap is located on the web etc

##What is Bootstrap? 

Bootstrap is a web framework that allows us to develop the interface (fromtscreen) of web sites, in our case Moodle, with the aid of components and templates, this software is free and is easily access through the bootstarp website.

Open a new tab on you web browser and copy and paste the following web address in the address bar of the new tab - http://getbootstrap.com/components/

As you can see we have landed on the Components page, this is where we will get some of our basics components for this lab, you will have to to go back and forth from Moodle to the Bootstrap components page a lot, so take a few a minutes to browse through somw of the components.

##What can I do with Bootstrap?

We can use any of these bootstrap components in Moodle, all of these components can be used individually or we can combine some conponents inside another compontent, that's for later labs :) for the time being I want you too look at the Jumbothron component

You can see what these components looks like and the `code` above, we need to get the code for this component and use it in Moodle, for us to use it we must **Copy (Ctrl C)** the code by clicking the Copy button, do this in the *Bootstrap* tab of your Web Browser, this will copy the code to the clipboard of the machine your using.

A jumbotron is mainly used as a welcome message, and in Moodle we normally use it in the Welcome section.
