#Housekeeping

We have place in some bootstrap components in order to make the module more engaging and to make it easier to navigate and provide a better user experience.

We need to tidy up our Training Area so we can improve on the work we have done with Bootstrap.

##Delete Blocks 

Blocks are located down the left hand side of the Moodle page in your module, delete all but the essential blocks.

- turn editing on and locate the block you want to delete.
